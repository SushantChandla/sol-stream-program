# SOL Stream Program
Real-time streaming can be understood as a constant flow of assets from one wallet to another over a period of time. It simplifies transactions and also enables a trustless environment. Subscription services or freelancers can use streaming transactions to maintain a trustless environment with their customers. There are many uses of this concept. This could change the obsolete ways used nowadays which involve setting transactions, setting agreements, and hence open up many possibilities in recurring transactions, micro-consultation services, and other engagements where time is money.
